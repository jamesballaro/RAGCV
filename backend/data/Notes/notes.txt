•	Interested in scaling operations beyond a single stand:
•	Second location near the park
•	Possibly a mobile stand (wagon-based)
•	Would like a way to record sales automatically instead of tally marks
•	Curious how supermarkets decide prices without asking their parents
•	Notices that:
•	Sunny days increase demand
•	Sourness tolerance varies by age
•	Frustrated that experiments take a long time because:
•	Lemon supply is limited
•	Parents impose “bedtime constraints”
•	Enjoys:
•	Making signs
•	Counting money
•	Deciding what to change the next day
•	Dislikes:
•	Repeating the same recipe forever
•	Jobs where nothing visibly happens
•	Long-term ideas:
•	Lemonade subscription service
•	Flavored sampler packs
•	Becoming “Head of Drinks” somewhere important
