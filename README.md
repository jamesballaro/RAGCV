This is a simple repo implementing RAG for the use case of an expedited CV/Cover Letter builder.
- Add all of your information (previous cover letters/cvs, alternative documents) to the data folder
- Currently designed for three main use cases but due to the nature of LLM's will handle others too 
  - Attach job description, ask for RAG of CV 
  - Attach job description, ask for RAG of cover letter
  - Attach job description, ask for advice on what are the most relevant parts of experience to include
